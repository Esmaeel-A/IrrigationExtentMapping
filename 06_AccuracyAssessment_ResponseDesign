// Labeling Reference data 
// Set location and time 
// 1-	Double-click on the polygon to check the ID and navigate automatically to its location
 
// 2-	Confirm if the polygon is on agricultural land. If it’s agricultural land, move to step 3; otherwise, assign it a value from below and move on
// >>> 0 If it’s not agricultural land
// >>> 5 If only 30% or less of the polygon area overlaps agricultural land (e.g, the above screenshot)
// >>> 6 if it’s tree (forest or tree crops)
// 3-	Click the history bar and make sure it’s on the year of interest (start with the most recent year); pay attention to which month you are looking at. 
// 4-	Check the polygon location in the agricultural field, check the surrounding fields, the existence of irrigation infrastructure, and the location's proximity to it.
// Make an educated guess
// 5-	Make an educated guess based on
// a.	The above location information (proximity to irrigation infra, texture contrast among neighboring fields)
// b.	Water reservoir (Example in Figure 1)
// c.	The greenness in the year and month appears in the VHR satellite images (sometimes more than one image available per year, check all photos from different months)
// d.	The level of management (tillage/plowing), planting patterns, and texture you can observe in the VHR
// What to look for?
// High greenness in summer >> likely irrigated
// High greenness in winter, but not in summer >> likely rainfed, check other clues 
// Confirm your guess and assign a value 
// 6-	Check the corresponding ID in the Excel sheet and locate the polygon/year. Check the NDVI value provided in the Excel sheet to confirm your decision. (this is the NDVI for June-July that year)
// Once you make a decision, overwrite the NDVI value using one of the following:
// 0 >>> non-agricultural land
// 1 >>> Rainfed
// 2 >>> Irrigated, but not sure
// 3 >>> Irrigated
// 4 >>> I can’t tell
// 5 >>> overlapping
// 6 >>> trees
// Check other years
// 7-	Move the history bar in Google Earth to the previous available year and repeat step 4
 
// 8-	Skip the years where VHR is unavailable; once all years with VHR images are completed, move to the next polygon
















// Clues (water reservoir): 
 
// Figure 1.a Empty Water reservoir
 
// Figure 1.b filled in Water reservoir: 36 01 27 N | 40 34 11 E | Feburary 2021
